While we think at the age of 7-8 years our child is too young for braces treatment, the most children have a mix of baby and permanent teeth our orthodontists can spot even small issues with your child’s bite and teeth alignment before they turn into any major problem, that might even need surgery if not treated at correct age. The American Academy of Orthodontists & Indian society of  Orthodontics and World Federation of Orthodontics recommends you take your child to see an orthodontist no later than age 7. 

At this age Our Orthodontist (braces specialists) are more concerned for the right growth and development of your child's jaw and face that will play a major role in ensuring proper airway functionality & normal face development for the aesthetic appearance of your child face. Even if your child’s teeth appear to be straight, it’s still a good idea to schedule an [appointment](/appointment) or [call](tel:+919810471255) with our orthodontist at Hapliv Dental Clinic in M3M Tee Point, Sector 65, Gurgaon. 

Your child’s bite or teeth alignment may change over time, which is why we may recommend your child see us every 6-12 months as their jaw grows very fast during adolescent age and permanent teeth erupt. Early intervention can prevent more serious issues from developing later and may reduce the need for more extensive treatment in the future.

There is no definitive answer to when you should take your child to an orthodontist, as every child's dental development is different. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you decide.However, this does not mean that your child will need braces right away. In fact, most children do not start braces treatment until they are between 9 and 14 years old, when most of their permanent teeth have erupted. The ideal time to start braces depends on several factors, such as the type and severity of the problem, the growth and development of the jaw and face, and the personal preference of the child and parent.

What are the early signs to detect whether your child will need braces or any other sort of Orthodontic treatment are:

1. Habits 
    - Thumb Sucking
    - Mouth Breathing 
    - Tongue thrusting
2. Early loss or delayed loss of baby teeth (milk teeth).
3. Difficulty in Biting or chewing 
4. Deep Bite or Underbite
5. Crooked teeth or Overlapping teeth
6. Gaps
7. Lip Trap
8. Frequent Gum Infections

If you notice any of these signs in your child, do not hesitate to contact our Orthodontist, Dr. Achla Verma at Hapliv Dental clinic. Taking your child to an orthodontist early can save you time, money, and hassle in the long run. It can also help your child achieve a healthy, beautiful smile that will boost their confidence and happiness. **These problems can affect your child's oral health, speech, chewing, and self-esteem.**


### What to expect during this visit to the braces specialist ?
1. An orthodontist will thoroughly examine your child’s hard and soft tissues which includes alignment of teeth, development of the jaw and soft tissues.
2. At Hapliv dental clinic our Orthodontist will let you know if there is proper growth and development happening in your child’s case. 
3. If there is some abnormality they will ask you for a few dental X-ray, Photographs and Digital/Intraoral dental impression of teeth to evaluate your child’s dental problem.
4. Based on the above mentioned records findings, Our Orthodontist will recommend a customized treatment plan that suits your child's needs and goals. They will also explain the benefits, risks, costs, and duration of the treatment, and answer any questions you may have.

The best way to determine when your child should see an orthodontist and whether they need braces is to consult with your dentist. Our Orthodontist can monitor your child's dental development as an orthodontist is a dentist who has received additional master training and certification in diagnosing and treating malocclusion (bad bite) and other dental irregularities. Braces are not only for children. Adults can also benefit from orthodontic treatment to improve their smile and oral health. Only consideration is your bone health should be in good condition. 

**However, it is easier to correct dental problems in children than in adults, as their bones and tissues are still growing and more responsive to treatment. Therefore, it is advisable to take your child to an orthodontist as soon as possible if you notice any signs of malocclusion or other dental issues.**
