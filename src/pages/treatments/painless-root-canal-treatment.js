                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 sm:text-xl">
                    Root Canal Treatment (RCT) is a dental procedure used to save and repair a tooth that is badly decayed, infected, or damaged. It involves removing the infected pulp (nerve and soft tissue) inside the tooth, cleaning and disinfecting the canals, and then sealing them to prevent further infection by adding medicament followed by a dental crown often placed after RCT to restore the tooth’s strength and functionality.

                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 sm:text-xl">Root Canal Treatment (RCT) is recommended for individuals experiencing severe tooth decay, infection, or damage affecting the inner pulp of the tooth. You may need an RCT if you have:</p>
                <ul className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 list-disc list-inside sm:text-xl">
                    <li><strong>Persistent Tooth Pain</strong> – Continuous or severe pain, especially while chewing or applying pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensitivity to Hot & Cold</strong> – Lingering discomfort after consuming hot or cold foods and drinks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swollen or Tender Gums</strong> – Inflammation, swelling, or a small pimple (abscess) near the affected tooth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep Cavity or Decay</strong> – A large cavity that has reached the nerve, causing infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cracked, Chipped, or Injured Teeth</strong> – Trauma or damage exposing the inner pulp.</li>
                    <li><strong>Darkening or Discoloration of a Tooth</strong> – A sign of internal damage or infection.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 sm:text-3xl">Advantages of Root Canal Treatment (RCT) Over Tooth Extraction</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 sm:text-xl">When faced with a severely damaged or infected tooth, many patients wonder whether to save the tooth with a Root Canal Treatment (RCT) or extract it. Here’s why RCT is the better option over tooth Extraction:</p>
        <ul className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 list-disc list-inside sm:text-xl">
          <li><strong>Saves Your Natural Tooth</strong> – Nothing functions as well as your own natural tooth. RCT preserves your original tooth structure, preventing bone loss and shifting of adjacent teeth.</li>
          <li><strong>Painless & Comfortable Procedure</strong> – With modern anesthesia and advanced techniques, RCT is as comfortable as a regular filling. Tooth extraction can be more painful post-treatment and may require extra procedures like implants or bridges that will hit your pocket.</li>
          <li><strong>Prevents Jawbone Loss</strong> – Tooth extraction leads to bone resorption (loss of jawbone density) over time. RCT allows you to retain your natural tooth and maintain bone health.</li>
          <li><strong>No Need for Replacements (Implants/Bridges)</strong> – After an extraction, you may need a dental implant or bridge, which can be expensive and time-consuming. RCT eliminates this need and restores full function without additional procedures.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintains Natural Bite & Chewing Ability</strong> – Extracting a tooth creates a gap, affecting your ability to chew properly. RCT restores strength and function, allowing you to eat comfortably.</li>
          <li><strong>Aesthetic & Long-Lasting Solution</strong> – A crown after RCT keeps your smile intact, maintaining a natural and attractive appearance. Missing teeth from extraction can lead to a sunken facial appearance over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost-Effective in the Long Run</strong> – Although extraction may seem cheaper initially, replacing a lost tooth with implants, dentures, or bridges costs much more. RCT with a crown is a one-time investment that lasts a lifetime with proper care.</li>
          <li><strong>Less Recovery Time & Fewer Complications</strong> – RCT has a shorter healing period, allowing you to resume normal activities quickly. Extraction may require sutures, prolonged healing, and potential complications like dry socket.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 sm:text-xl"><strong>Conclusion: RCT is the Better Choice!</strong> At Hapliv Dental Clinic (Gurgaon & West Delhi), we recommend saving your natural tooth whenever possible. RCT is a safe, effective, and long-lasting solution that helps you maintain a healthy and confident smile.</p>

      <section id="re-rct" className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 sm:text-3xl">What is Re-RCT (Root Canal Retreatment)?</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 sm:text-xl">
          Re-RCT (Root Canal Retreatment) is a repeat root canal procedure performed when the previously treated tooth does not heal properly or develops a new infection after 5-25 years due to poor oral hygiene or a poor systemic health condition. This involves removing the old filling, cleaning the canals again, and resealing them to ensure complete infection removal and healing.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 sm:text-2xl">Why is Re-RCT Important?</h3>
        <ul className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 list-disc list-inside sm:text-xl">
          <li>Eliminate remaining bacteria or infection that may have been missed in the first RCT.</li>
          <li>Save the tooth from extraction and avoid costly replacements like implants or bridges.</li>
          <li>Strengthen the tooth by improving the seal and ensuring long-term functionality.</li>
          <li>Prevent further complications, such as abscess formation, swelling, or bone loss.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 sm:text-2xl">Why Do I Need Re-RCT After Already Having an RCT?</h3>
        <ul className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 list-disc list-inside sm:text-xl">
          <li>Incomplete Cleaning & Sealing – If some infection or bacteria remain inside the canals.</li>
          <li>New Infection or Decay – If a new cavity develops, leading to reinfection.</li>
          <li>Cracked or Damaged Filling/Crown – If the filling or crown leaks, bacteria can re-enter.</li>
          <li>Missed Canals or Complex Anatomy – Some teeth have extra canals that may have been overlooked.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 sm:text-2xl">Is Re-RCT Painful?</h3>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 sm:text-xl">No! Re-RCT is performed under anesthesia, ensuring a pain-free experience. With modern technology and expert endodontists at Hapliv Dental Clinic, discomfort is minimal, just like a regular RCT.</p>
