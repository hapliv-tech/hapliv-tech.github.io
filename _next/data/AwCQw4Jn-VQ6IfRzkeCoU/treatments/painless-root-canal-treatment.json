If the tooth decay is limited to the first two layers, it can be corrected with Filling/ Restoration. In case the tooth decay reaches the third layer and causes inflammation or infection of pulp, an RCT or Endodontic Treatment is needed. A dentist at the nearest dental clinic should be consulted at the earliest in such cases.","link":""}},"__N_SSG":true}
