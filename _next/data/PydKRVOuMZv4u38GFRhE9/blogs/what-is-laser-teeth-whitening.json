While there are several methods of teeth whitening available, one of the most popular options is laser teeth whitening. In this blog post, we'll explore what laser teeth whitening is, how it works, and what you can expect from the procedure.\n\n## What is Laser Teeth Whitening?\n\nLaser teeth whitening is a cosmetic dental treatment that uses a special laser light to activate a whitening gel that has been applied to the surface of your teeth. The laser light helps to accelerate the whitening process, resulting in brighter and whiter teeth in a shorter amount of time than traditional teeth whitening methods.\n\n## How Does Laser Teeth Whitening Work?\n\nDuring the laser teeth whitening procedure, a dental professional will apply a whitening gel to your teeth. The gel is made up of a hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide solution that helps to break down the stains on your teeth and whiten them. Once the gel has been applied, a special laser light is directed at your teeth to activate the whitening gel and speed up the whitening process.\n\nThe laser light helps to penetrate the teeth, allowing the whitening gel to work more effectively and remove more stubborn stains. The entire procedure usually takes around 60-90 minutes, and most patients only need one session to achieve the desired level of whitening.\n\n## What Can You Expect During the Procedure?\n\nBefore the procedure, your dentist will examine your teeth and gums to ensure that you are a good candidate for laser teeth whitening. They may also clean your teeth to remove any debris or plaque before applying the whitening gel.\n\nOnce the whitening gel has been applied, your dentist will direct the laser light at your teeth for a certain amount of time, usually around 15-20 minutes. You may feel a slight warming or tingling sensation during this time, but the procedure is generally painless.\n\nAfter the laser teeth whitening procedure is complete, your dentist may apply a fluoride treatment to help reduce any sensitivity you may experience. You can expect to see immediate results, with your teeth appearing several shades brighter and whiter.\n\nIn conclusion, laser teeth whitening is a popular and effective way to achieve a brighter and whiter smile. While the cost of the procedure can vary depending on your location and the dental clinic, it is generally a safe and painless treatment that can provide immediate results. If you're interested in laser teeth whitening, talk to your dentist to see if it's the right option for you.","recommendation":[{"slug":"aftercare-tips-for-dental-extraction","frontmatter":{"title":"Aftercare Tips for Dental Extraction or Wisdom Tooth Extraction","author":"Dr. Achla Verma","date":"May 7, 2023","excerpt":"Post Dental Surgery tips & Precautions","cover_image":"/assets/blog/extraction.jpeg","keywords":"dental extraction,wisdom tooth extraction, care post dental extraction, dental surgery,teeth extraction near me gurgaon, impaction, dental care","description":"After any surgical procedure or any injury whether intentional or unintentional in body will lead to inflammation in body to help in faster healing of surgical site/injury which is a normal phenomena, Similarly in oral cavity too after dental extraction or dental surgery the nerve endings and bone are open source for normal bacterial flora of our mouth to enter into systemic supply even after suture.
